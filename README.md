## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Deployment Notes

This project is deployed as a static website on Azure Blob Storage.

### Key Azure Services Used:

* **Resource Group:** `fantasyGalleryRG` (or `myStaticWebsiteRG` if you reused the previous one) - A logical container for Azure resources.
* **Storage Account:** `myfantasygallery123` (or your chosen unique name) - Stores all the website assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
* **Static Website Hosting:** A feature enabled on the Storage Account to serve web content directly from the `$web` container.

### Deployment Steps Summary:

1.  **Create a Resource Group** in the Azure Portal.
2.  **Create a Storage Account** within that Resource Group.
3.  **Enable Static Website Hosting** in the Storage Account settings, setting `index.html` as the index document. This generates the primary endpoint URL.
4.  **Upload all project files** (`index.html`, `script.js`, `css/style.css`, and all files in `images/`) to the `$web` container, preserving the folder structure (e.g., `css/style.css` goes into a `css` folder within `$web`, `images/image1.jpg` goes into an `images` folder within `$web`). Azure Storage Explorer is recommended for easier folder uploads.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **Image Lightbox/Modal:** Implement a feature to view larger versions of images when clicked.
* **Search/Filter Functionality:** Add a search bar or filter options based on image categories (e.g., "Creatures," "Landscapes").
* **Preloader:** A simple loading animation while images are being fetched.
* **Azure Static Web Apps:** Migrate to Azure Static Web Apps for integrated CI/CD directly from a Git repository (e.g., GitHub), simplifying deployment and offering more features like custom domains out-of-the-box.
* **Custom Domain:** Connect a custom domain name (e.g., `www.yourfantasygallery.com`) to the deployed site.
* **Accessibility Improvements:** Enhance keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
